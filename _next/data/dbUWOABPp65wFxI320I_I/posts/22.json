Apologies for my non native English.<br>\nThese days it’s a shame to refer to the lack of information. All we need is Internet. Not even always.<br>\nTiny spoiler: there is no “language barrier”. Forget about it. It does not exist. We either learn or looking for the reason to not to.</p>\n<p>Here is (incomplete) prioritized list of things we can do.</p>\n<p><strong>Switch all devices to the language you learn.</strong><br>\nThis is first and the most important thing to do. More likely you have at least phone and laptop.\nThus, all your daily routine (calls, sms, using apps with a non native language) will become habitual in a while.\nIf you are furious at incomprehension of everything that was so common so far — you are on the right track.</p>\n<p><strong>Read articles. Aloud.</strong><br>\nVery important one. Visit any site with foreign language and read. Aloud. When you are at home.\nIn a public transport. Whisper if you hesitate. If you don’t have access to\nthe Internet when in the city, open the article beforehand.</p>\n<p>News site is the best fit. Pick topics you are interested in.\nEveryone has its favorite work/hobby/something that makes the heart beat faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch movies/soccer/series/whatever with/without subtitles.</strong><br>\nChoose any appropriate way of absorbing content. The main thing is to hear language,\nto pay attention to pronunciation and accent. Subtitles in native language,\nsubtitles in foreign language, without subtitles. Whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>Speak.</strong><br>\nThere is nothing to add here.<br>\nP.S. Sometimes it’s not the best option in the very beginning as you need a partner or a person you trust\nor something else. Simply put, it is something that depends not on you only. I am ready to argue with it though.</p>\n<p><strong>Use apps and extensions.</strong><br>\nThese are apps with the possibility to translate words/word combinations when you select them,\nbrowser extension which can work when you hover over the word or select a number of\nwords and then again hover over selected area.</p>\n<p><strong>Communicate in chat rooms (make typing a habit).</strong><br>\nRequires certain knowledge. Do it if you feel you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Move to the country where language is used.</strong><br>\nOne more item not available to all. We should try to travel and use a language although.\nIf you need a phrase book with a local language — good. If you don’t need — good.\nIf you rent a bicycle, book accommodation via phone, order pizza — perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Find a job where language is preferable/mandatory.</strong><br>\nControversial one, but works under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>Register and use at least one site for learning.</strong><br>\nNot a foreground for me, however it works for some people. Again, use it if it works for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Listen to audio.</strong><br>\nI was trying. It does not work for me. Audio is hard enough to perceive.\nListening songs without lyrics before the eyes practically does not work for non native speakers.\nI assume it makes more sense when the level is almost like the native speaker.</p>\n<p><strong>Take classes/private lessons.</strong><br>\nThe last but not least. If you need discipline, if you need to attend classes three times a\nweek and do hometasks — great. I am not saying it’s inefficient.\nI don’t even want to figure out why it’s not an option for me.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The goal.</strong> Eventually, if you were in a situation when you need a language,\nit doesn’t matter how hard did you try, what did you do, why you had a headache on\nMonday and missed the very important topic during class therefore.\nThe motivation does not matter. The only result is important.</p>\n<p>Surround yourself with a language. Let it be everywhere.</p>\n<p>P.S. I intentionally do not make any lists of programs, apps, sites etc.\nas there is no reason to impose and force anyone to do/download/install whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Hope you find it useful and thanks for reading.</p>\n","title":"How to learn foreign languages.
