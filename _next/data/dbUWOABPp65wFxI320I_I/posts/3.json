A lot of positive emotions in spite of not being very good sound for the band\nof this magnitude and awesome atmosphere which gave Prime Hall and Morcheeba!</p>\n<p>I was for the first time in this place and for sure for the first time at the Morcheeba concert.\nIf I have an opportunity to visit the same performance, I would use it. At least for the next day.\nAt least for all the same songs.</p>\n<p>Prime Hall is beautiful.\nI can't believe the club accommodates up to 500 people! No squares, no stadiums. And Morcheeba was there!<br>\nThis is perfect. Atmosphere was like this Maroon 5 Montreal performance.</p>\n<p>Oh, Maroon, when you arrive in Minsk?</p>\n<p>Video report can be seen <a href=\"https://yadi.sk/d/tMbhUXY6dQ7tq\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>P.S. Video from a wonderful performance in Lugano.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n","title":"Morhceeba concert","date":"2014-12-16 02:10:14"}},"__N_SSG":true}
