A lot of positive emotions in spite of not being very good sound for the band \nof this magnitude and awesome atmosphere which gave Prime Hall and Morcheeba!\n\nI was for the first time in this place and for sure for the first time at the Morcheeba concert.\nIf I have an opportunity to visit the same performance, I would use it. At least for the next day.\nAt least for all the same songs. \n\nPrime Hall is beautiful.\nI can't believe the club accommodates up to 500 people! No squares, no stadiums. And Morcheeba was there!  \nThis is perfect. Atmosphere was like this Maroon 5 Montreal performance.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/c-jojTa6_0Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nOh, Maroon, when you arrive in Minsk?\n\nVideo report can be seen [here](https://yadi.sk/d/tMbhUXY6dQ7tq).\n\nP.S.
