I can not help but share. A lot of positive emotions in spite of not being very good sound for the band 
of this magnitude and awesome atmosphere which gave Prime Hall and Morcheeba!

I was for the first time in this place and for sure for the first time at the Morcheeba concert.
If I have an opportunity to visit the same performance, I would use it. At least for the next day.
At least for all the same songs. 

Prime Hall is beautiful.
I can't believe the club accommodates up to 500 people! No squares, no stadiums. And Morcheeba was there!  
This is perfect. Atmosphere was like this Maroon 5 Montreal performance.

Oh, Maroon, when you arrive in Minsk?

P.S. Video from a wonderful performance in Lugano.
