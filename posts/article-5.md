Reading is one of the most fundamental skills we learn in life. While most of us are accustomed to reading left-to-right (LTR), there’s a technique that could reduce your reading time - **alternating between LTR and right-to-left (RTL)** reading. 

In this article, we’ll explore how switching between these two reading directions can potentially help you read faster, how long it might take to learn this technique, and the cognitive processes behind it.

### What is LTR and RTL Reading?

- **LTR (Left-to-Right)** reading is the most common reading style in many languages, including English, Spanish, and French. You read each line of text starting from the left and continue until you reach the end, then move on to the next line.
  
- **RTL (Right-to-Left)** reading is used in languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian. In this case, you begin reading from the right side of the page and work your way leftward, moving to the next line once you’ve reached the end.

Now, imagine if you could combine the two methods in a single passage - reading alternate lines in LTR and RTL directions.

This approach isn’t just for fun; it could save you time by eliminating the need for **return sweeps** when your eyes move from one line to the next.

### A few factors to consider:
**Cognitive Load:**
Switching directions requires extra cognitive processing, especially if the reader has to focus on where to start and adjust mentally. This extra step could slightly slow down the process.

**Eye Movement:**
In languages like Arabic or Hebrew (which read right to left), the eyes naturally move in that direction. But switching between LTR and RTL will likely introduce a momentary "recalibration" as the reader shifts their focus back and forth. This could cause a slight increase in the number of eye movements, even if the person is used to both directions.

### How Does It Save Time?

When you read in the traditional LTR method, you finish a line and then move your eyes back to the beginning of the next line. This process is known as a return sweep, and it typically takes a small amount of time (around 0.3 seconds).

However, if you alternate between LTR and RTL, the end of each RTL line is aligned with the start of the next LTR line. This means you won’t need to make a return sweep at the end of each line, saving you precious milliseconds as your eyes don’t need to go back to the left side of the page.

### Here is a sample story

Elias woke up early one crisp morning, the sun barely peeking over the horizon, casting a soft <br />
golden glow across the city. He could hear the faint hum of traffic, even at this early hour, as <br />
people rushed to their destinations. The streets were wet from the overnight rain, and the air <br />
smelled fresh and clean. He grabbed his jacket, pulled it tight around his shoulders, and stepped <br />
outside. The cool breeze kissed his face, and he breathed in deeply, feeling the freshness of the <br />
morning air. The city was slowly waking up, each street and building coming to life as the world <br />
began its usual rhythm. Elias walked down the familiar path towards the corner café, where the <br />
smell of freshly brewed coffee was already wafting into the street. The doorbell chimed as he <br />
entered, and he nodded to the barista behind the counter, who smiled and greeted him by name. <br />
It was one of those small moments that made the city feel like home. He ordered his usual black <br />
coffee, took a seat by the window, and watched as the world outside continued to move in its <br />
chaotic dance. People walked by, heads down, lost in their own thoughts. Some were rushing, <br />
others strolling. A cyclist zoomed past, narrowly avoiding a puddle. The quiet hum of the café <br />
provided a sense of calm amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. Elias took a sip of his coffee, <br />
letting the warmth spread through him. There was something comforting about the routine of it <br /> 
all, the predictability of the daily grind. It gave him a sense of purpose, something to anchor <br />
himself to in the midst of the ever-moving city. <br />

### Does This Work in Practice?

This could be useful if people were trained to read this way fluently. Some ancient scripts (like [Boustrophedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon) writing in Greek) actually used this method!

### How Much Time Could You Save?

Let’s look at the potential time saved:

- For a typical reading speed of 250 words per minute (WPM), each line takes about 2.88 seconds to read.
- The return sweep normally adds about 0.3 seconds of extra time for each line.
- By alternating LTR and RTL, you eliminate the return sweep for every line, potentially saving **8.7 seconds** for a 300-word passage.

This might not sound like much, but over time, especially with longer texts, the time saved adds up. On average, you could save about **12%** of your total reading time when reading in alternating LTR/RTL direction.

## How Long Does It Take to Learn?

Learning to alternate between LTR and RTL isn’t as simple as it sounds. Since you’re training your brain to read in both directions, it takes time to become proficient.

Here’s a breakdown of how long it might take:

### Week 1-2: Initial Familiarization

In the first two weeks, you’ll likely be getting accustomed to the process. During this stage, your focus will be on understanding the mechanics of switching directions without causing confusion. If you’ve never read in RTL before, this could be the most challenging part. But with consistent practice, the cognitive load will begin to decrease.

### Week 3-4: Basic Practice

After a few weeks of practice, you’ll likely become more comfortable with reading alternating LTR/RTL lines. At this point, you’ll be able to read more fluently, but there may still be moments where you hesitate or feel unsure. The key here is regular practice - you should aim to read for 15-30 minutes daily, focusing on the alternating reading pattern.

### Month 1-2: Fluency

With about one to two months of regular practice, you should start reading fluently in both directions. Your brain will no longer get confused when switching between LTR and RTL lines, and you’ll be able to read seamlessly. At this point, you’ll likely notice that reading feels more natural, and you may even begin to appreciate the time saved with this technique.

## Should You Try It?

So, should you give it a go? If you’re looking to optimize your reading time and are willing to put in the practice, alternating between LTR and RTL could be an interesting challenge. While it may take 1-2 months to master, the potential time savings over the long term might be worth it, especially for longer texts.

Moreover, learning to read in multiple directions could improve your cognitive flexibility and mental agility, making you better at handling information from different sources.

### Final Thoughts

The alternating LTR/RTL reading method is a fascinating approach that could help you save time and improve your reading efficiency. By eliminating return sweeps, you can reduce the time spent on each line of text, ultimately allowing you to read more quickly. While learning this technique takes time and practice, the long-term benefits could be significant.
