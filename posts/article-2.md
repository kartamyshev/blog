According to wikipedia
> [gentrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification) is the process of changing the character of a neighborhood through the influx of more affluent residents (the "gentry") and investment.

The term has rapidly grown in ubiquity recently. This could be just me being interested in problems it creates, not sure.
I've heard it in the context of Europe's either wealthy or touristic countries like Spain, Italy, Netherlands, especially in metropolitan areas, Mexico, Australia, United States etc.

Problems:
- Locals unable to find affordable living space
- Higher prices on everything - groceries, transportation, you name it.

One of the positive effects is **reduction in crime** which leads to economical growth.

Inreasing of welbeing of small amount of people - home owners, politicians etc.

It is very much connected to tourism.

Who is the average local resident? Is this term vague? Is it the one that was born in this place? Or someone who relocated and get legal documents, e.g. passport?

Rising housing prices are good for owners.
