It's nice to kick off the project with fully configured environment.
I've recently started looking deeply into 
[webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), 
it was one of the main instruments for about semiannual period of time although.
I just did not manage to make my own kind of fork of config file.

After a while I've reached some state called "I am in my element". 

It isn't perfect. It's not even a framework. It is trivial, because you can find 
dozens and dozens of similar solutions, especially on github. However it is mine.
No copypaste or something.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/kartamyshev/react-webpack-kit).
I'm planning to improve it little by little, fix issues, add features, 
deal with pitfalls etc. But it is definitely a big step forward for 
automation build process, workflow and such.
