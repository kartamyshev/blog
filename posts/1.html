This comes, however, with a great cost. It adds another layer of complexity on the top of frontend development process which is already overly complicated.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at <strong>advantages</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster development (after certain time).</li>
<li>No need to switch between layout and style files.</li>
<li>No (or almost no) cascades.</li>
<li>Developing design systems is a breath of fresh air.</li>
<li>No need to create omnipresent classes and mixins, same for every project. Good bye <code>sass</code>, <code>less</code> and alike.</li>
<li>Amazing error handling and autocompletion.</li>
<li>Unified developer-designer communication, everyone speaks the same language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Context switching is hard. Having css in the same place as html is good in this regard.<br/>
<!-- -->We don&#x27;t have to search for global css rules/mixins/variables all over the place. <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration">Config file</a> is the only entrypoint.<br/>
<!-- -->Often used styles are grouped and named clearly with meaningful defaults.<br/>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s not much to add to the strengths as they are pretty obvious and non negotiable.</p>
<p>Here are my subjective <strong>weaknesses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many CSS classes written in one line, each responsible for one or more property, can grow uncontrollably.
Sometimes they don&#x27;t fit the screen.</p>
<p>So, instead of regular</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">  .chat-notification {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      max-width: 24rem;
      margin: 0 auto;
      padding: 1.5rem;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      background-color: #fff;
      box-shadow: 0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 10px 10px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>we&#x27;re doing</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg flex items-center space-x-4&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This can be fixed by creating specfic class in configuration file (whichever the syntax is)</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">  module.exports = {
      theme: {
          chatNotification: {
              // ...rules
          },
      },
  };
</code></pre>
<p>but then there is no difference with moving all rules under one classname in css file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we move tailwind classes outside of html layout, autocompletion and tailwind error handling is lost.<br/>
<!-- -->Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// All good

&lt;div class=&quot;p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg flex items-center space-x-4&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// Error prone, so it&#x27;s easy to mistype

const getClassNames = (options) =&gt; &quot;p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg flex items-center space-x-4&quot;;
&lt;div className={getClassNames(options)} /&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tailwind CSS doesn&#x27;t usually add much CSS knowledge to the people using it.<br/>
<!-- -->And the derivation - a lot of CSS features, like grid, <code>:is</code>, <code>:where</code>, <code>:has</code> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-web-ui-io-2024">many others</a> are either hidden, abandoned or simply left behind the scenes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to focus on the last point more closely here.</p>
<p>I understand that cascades, inheritence, prioritization are complicated.
There are lots of rules, sometimes inconsistent, sometimes just difficult to comprehend because of various reasons.
There is no error handling - you forget to add semicolon and you get a blank screen. Not nice.</p>
<p>Historically CSS was never complete and was always behind business and subsequently designer needs.
Maybe exactly designers were the ones who pushed specifications the most for better.</p>
<p>But please name at least one technology that is perfect? There is none.
CSS is almost perfect for styling web pages. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever possible to find more concise and expressive way for the language to describe how something should look like. Probably <code>yaml</code> would do better. But something similar can be easily achieved with <a href="https://stylus-lang.com">stylus</a> (no advert) - awesome tool in its time, clearly an underdog between css preprocessors.</p>
<p>Tailwind doesn&#x27;t make a person a better developer. It makes person somewhat faster developer.
This isn&#x27;t the same. I consider utility approach taken by tailwind team harmful for the industry.
Since <code>tailwind</code> became a standart, we probably don&#x27;t even understand that bloated html is only top of the iceberg.
I wouldn&#x27;t even mention separation of concerns here. Stating this makes me too conservative which I am not.</p>
<p>It seems like we&#x27;re trying to write styles anywhere but where they belong to - css in js, jss, html etc.
The only important parameter is development speed whatever other tradeoffs are.</p>
<p>There is literally one big downside in not using tailwind these days - maintaining separate css files. This is a big issue for developers incuding myself. Mostly because time is money. Tools are important.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Cascades are complicated. Writing maintainable CSS is complicated. If we join this with
CSS not even considered a proper language to make fun of - we get unmaintainable CSS.</p>
<p>Tailwind will evolve. Maybe it will be replaced by even better similar tool.<br/>
<!-- -->But CSS will always be one step ahead. Utility first libraries are a thing of present.
It&#x27;s not a thing of the future.</p>
<p>Unlike good javascript frameworks that pushed native browser/javascript APIs for better, tailwind will have nothing to do with future of CSS and won&#x27;t affect it.</p></article></main><footer class="footer_container__lKLmx"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="footer_footerHeading__31g7U">Vanilla DOM</h2><div class="footer_footerColWrapper__z58WP"><div class="footer_footerCol__2k2ax footer_footerCol1__B4QIf"><ul class="footer_contactList__MmfXw"><li><a href="mailto:kartamyshev.k@gmail.com">kartamyshev.k@gmail.com</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer_footerCol__2k2ax footer_footerCol2__mam6v"><ul class="footer_socialMediaList__8_BJA"><li><a href="https://github.com/kartamyshev"><span class="footer_icon__0xdki"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388, 0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159, 0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481, 0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816, 0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049, 10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718, 3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659, 0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423, 1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0, 2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0, 1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028, 5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"></path></svg></span><span class="username">kartamyshev</span></a></li></ul></div><div class="footer_footerCol__2k2ax footer_footerCol3___NGyQ"><p class="footer_text__v8yER"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HlE_oRdROo">Lovely music from footer</a></p></div></div></div></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"id":1,"contentHTML":"\n[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is an amazing set of tools, including autocompletion, built-in wide used classnames and mixins etc, developed by talented people.
