I’d like to share my experience of learning foreign languages. 
Not that I’m a person to listen to, but probably someone will find it useful. Apologies for my non native English.  
These days it’s a shame to refer to the lack of information. All we need is Internet. Not even always.  
Tiny spoiler: there is no “language barrier”. Forget about it. It does not exist. We either learn or looking for the reason to not to.

Here is (incomplete) prioritized list of things we can do.


**Switch all devices to the language you learn.**  
This is first and the most important thing to do. More likely you have at least phone and laptop. 
Thus, all your daily routine (calls, sms, using apps with a non native language) will become habitual in a while. 
If you are furious at incomprehension of everything that was so common so far — you are on the right track.

**Read articles. Aloud.**  
Very important one. Visit any site with foreign language and read. Aloud. When you are at home. 
In a public transport. Whisper if you hesitate. If you don’t have access to 
the Internet when in the city, open the article beforehand.  

News site is the best fit. Pick topics you are interested in. 
Everyone has its favorite work/hobby/something that makes the heart beat faster.

**Watch movies/soccer/series/whatever with/without subtitles.**  
Choose any appropriate way of absorbing content. The main thing is to hear language, 
to pay attention to pronunciation and accent. Subtitles in native language, 
subtitles in foreign language, without subtitles. Whatever.

**Speak.**  
There is nothing to add here.  
P.S. Sometimes it’s not the best option in the very beginning as you need a partner or a person you trust 
or something else. Simply put, it is something that depends not on you only. I am ready to argue with it though.

**Use apps and extensions.**  
These are apps with the possibility to translate words/word combinations when you select them, 
browser extension which can work when you hover over the word or select a number of 
words and then again hover over selected area.

**Communicate in chat rooms (make typing a habit).**  
Requires certain knowledge. Do it if you feel you can.

**Move to the country where language is used.**  
One more item not available to all. We should try to travel and use a language although. 
If you need a phrase book with a local language — good. If you don’t need — good. 
If you rent a bicycle, book accommodation via phone, order pizza — perfect.

**Find a job where language is preferable/mandatory.**  
Controversial one, but works under certain circumstances.

**Register and use at least one site for learning.**  
Not a foreground for me, however it works for some people. Again, use it if it works for you.

**Listen to audio.**  
I was trying. It does not work for me. Audio is hard enough to perceive. 
Listening songs without lyrics before the eyes practically does not work for non native speakers. 
I assume it makes more sense when the level is almost like the native speaker.

**Take classes/private lessons.**  
The last but not least. If you need discipline, if you need to attend classes three times a 
week and do hometasks — great. I am not saying it’s inefficient. 
I don’t even want to figure out why it’s not an option for me.

***
**The goal.** Eventually, if you were in a situation when you need a language, 
it doesn’t matter how hard did you try, what did you do, why you had a headache on 
Monday and missed the very important topic during class therefore. 
The motivation does not matter. The only result is important.

Surround yourself with a language. Let it be everywhere.

P.S. I intentionally do not make any lists of programs, apps, sites etc. 
as there is no reason to impose and force anyone to do/download/install whatsoever.

Hope you find it useful and thanks for reading.
